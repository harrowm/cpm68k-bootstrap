# cpm68k-bootstrap
Bootstrapping cpm68k into memory on a rosco_m68k single board computer ...

After trying for a while to modify a bios written in 68000 machine code, I thought I would stop and try to get a basic cmp68k up and running with a bios in C.  My C is much better than my 68000 machine code skills ..

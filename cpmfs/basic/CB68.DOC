|                                                                |
|                           SOFTWARE NOTES                       |
|             ===========================================        |
|                                                                |
|       1. PRINT USING statement outputs an incorrect exponent   |
|          value if the value is negative and the format field   |
|          does  not  contain  a  digit  position  before  the   |
|          decimal point.  To  work-around,  always  provide a   |
|          digit position or  leading negative sign before the   |
|          decimal point.  For example, #.####^ or -.####^.      |
|                                                                |
|       2. Hexadecimal   constants   between   0FA000000   and   |
|          0FAFFFFFF inclusive  produce an  internal  compiler   |
|          failure  (FATAL COMPILER ERROR 210)  or  cause  the   |
|          compiler  to  hang.      To  work-around,  use  the   |
|          equivalent decimal values.                            |
|                                                                |
|       3. The run-time system  does not trap  error CM when a   |
|          .68K file specified in a CHAIN statement  cannot be   |
|          found in the directory.  To work-around, attempt to   |
|          OPEN the file prior to chaining.                      |
|                                                                |
|       4. An exponential expression  whose  exponent and base   |
|          both equal zero,  evaluates  to  1.    However,  if   |
|          either or both the exponent and base is represented   |
|          by  a real  variable,  the  exponential  expression   |
|          evaluates to 0.                                       |
|                                                                |
|       5. The compiler does not report an error when a prompt   |
|          string for an INPUT LINE statement is not a literal   |
|          string constant.  To work-around, do not use string   |
|          variables or expressions as prompt strings.           |
|                                                                |
|       6. The  N  toggle  does  not  work   with  the  %DEBUG   |
|          directive as documented.  To work-around, use the N   |
|          toggle as a standard command line option only.        |
|                                                                |
|       7. The run-time  system  does  not  detect  error  CX.   |
|          (An overlay does not fit in the overlay area.)        |
|                                                                |
|       8. A PRINT # statement that ends  with a comma  or  a    |
|          backslash, produces and internal compiler failure.    |
|          (FATAL COMPILER ERROR 214)                            |
|                                                                |
|                             Page 1                             |
|                                                                |

|       9. Integers  are  32-bit,    two's  complement  binary   |
|          numbers that range from  -2147483648 to +2147483647   |
|          inclusive.                                            |
|                                                                |
|      10. Maximum string  length  is  2147483647  characters.   |
|          Strings are stored internally with 4 length bytes.    |
|                                                                |
|      11. The LINK68 CH command line option is  required  to    |
|          link chained modules.  If you omit the  CH  option    |
|          from the command line,  LINK68 outputs  the  error    |
|          "<_cbmain>" DOUBLY DEFINED in <filename>              |
|                                                                |
|      12. The run-time system does not support the  graphics    |
|          extensions  or  the  DATE$  and  TIME$  functions.    |
|          However, these keywords  are  still  reserved  for    |
|          future implementations of CB68.                       |
|                                                                |
|                                                                |

|          The following  notes apply to the "CBASIC Compiler    |
|          (CB68) Programmer's Guide for the CP/M-68K  Family    |
